# MediaPipe Model

Please download the **Hand Landmarker** model from MediaPipe and place it here.

2.  Download the `hand_landmarker.task` file.
3.  Place the downloaded file in this directory (`public/models/`).

The application will fail to load the hand tracking functionality if this file is missing.
